- [ ] I have added a .ini file to DashMachine with the same name used for [App Name] in the .ini file (e.g. 'App Name.ini')
- [ ] My .ini has the exact format as the others in the folder, only changing the name, icon location, and description.
- [ ] I used the official description and name for the app, found on their repository/website.
- [ ] I chose an icon (.png file) sized under 200px, with a transparent background, preferably the icon only version (not icon w/ text) of the app's icon.
- [ ] I have added the icon to static/images/apps with the correct name matching what's in the .ini.
- [ ] I tested it to make sure it looks good in the interface
